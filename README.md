BMI CALCULATOR

The BMI Calculator is a simple and user-friendly web application that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user’s height and weight inputs. It provides instant results along with the corresponding health category such as Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, or Obese.

This project is built using React and demonstrates the use of functional components, React Hooks (useState), event handling, conditional logic, and basic form validation. It also focuses on clean UI design and real-time user interaction.
